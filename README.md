We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

2. Click on the poster for a movie to get additional details for that film.
3. Click "Add A Movie" in the navbar to go to the Add Movies page.
